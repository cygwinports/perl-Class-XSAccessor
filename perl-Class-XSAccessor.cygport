NAME="perl-Class-XSAccessor"
VERSION=1.16
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl hash object accessor module"
DESCRIPTION="Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and read/write
accessors in XS. Additionally, it can provide predicates such as 'has_foo()'
for testing whether the attribute 'foo' is defined in the object. It only
works with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes."
